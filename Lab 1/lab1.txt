Lab 1 Report:

Step 1-3 Observation:
	When I run the program without an argument(delay), I get a seg fault.

Step 4 Observation:
	When I run with delay 500, towards the end, the child process finishes before the parent process finishes. However, when I run it with 5000 delay, the printouts come out the way they're supposed to.
